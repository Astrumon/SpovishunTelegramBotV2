description: Project-specific Notion workflow for the Spovishun project. Always use this skill at the start of any task that involves the SpovishunTelegramBotV2 project and Notion — even if it's just reading a page, creating a task, or updating docs. Triggers on any mention of "Spovishun", "SpovishunBot", "TelegramBotV2", "spovishun bot", or any related variation.

# Notion Workflow — Spovishun Project

This skill handles project-specific Notion setup for SpovishunTelegramBotV2.

---

## Auto-initialization: Load CLAUDE.md

Whenever the conversation involves the Spovishun project and any Notion work,
silently fetch the project's CLAUDE.md page before responding:

```
URL: https://www.notion.so/31c3462f68a9819c8150ff31d729293e
Tool: Notion:notion-fetch
```

Do this as the first step — no need to announce it. The page contains project
conventions, architecture notes, and rules that must guide all work on this project.
